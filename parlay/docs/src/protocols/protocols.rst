Custom Protocols
================


The Parlay Broker supports custom protocols written in Python that can integrate with any
off-the-shelf or custom components that communicate any some way.

Got an off-the-shelf USB camera or serial motor controller that you want to hook up to Parlay?
Write a custom protocol for it (see how below) and it will be connected to the Parlay
system, and can be controlled by the browser UI, scripts, and any other item connected
to the system.

The best way to demonstrate is with an example.

Parlay Documentation
====================

**Parlay** is a software framework that makes it easier to develop, test, and connect embedded devices.

With Parlay, you can control your hardware quickly and easily.  You write code that maps
your hardware functionality to Parlay **Items**, with **Commands** and **Properties**.

Then you can:
  * Explore, poke, and prod items from our built-in brower-based User Interface
  * Plot and log streamed data from sensors
  * Create repeatable, automatic tests with simple-syntax Python scripts
  * Easily integrate with user-facing applications, mobile apps, and more...

The core of Parlay is written in Python, so it is **cross-platform**.  It can run on your Windows, OSX, or Linux
PC.

Parlay can also run on your device, assuming your device runs embedded Linux or Windows.
